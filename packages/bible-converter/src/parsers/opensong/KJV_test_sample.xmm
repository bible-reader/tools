  <b n="Genesis">
    <c n="1">
      <v n="1">In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</v>
      <v n="2">And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</v>
      <v n="3">And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</v>
      <v n="4">And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.</v>
      <v n="5">And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</v>
      <v n="6">And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</v>
      <v n="7">And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.</v>
      <v n="8">And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.</v>
      <v n="9">And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</v>
      <v n="10">And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</v>
      <v n="11">And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</v>
      <v n="12">And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</v>
      <v n="13">And the evening and the morning were the third day.</v>
      <v n="14">And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</v>
      <v n="15">And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.</v>
      <v n="16">And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</v>
      <v n="17">And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</v>
      <v n="18">And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</v>
      <v n="19">And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</v>
      <v n="20">And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</v>
      <v n="21">And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</v>
      <v n="22">And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</v>
      <v n="23">And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</v>
      <v n="24">And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.</v>
      <v n="25">And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</v>
      <v n="26">And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</v>
      <v n="27">So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</v>
      <v n="28">And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</v>
      <v n="29">And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</v>
      <v n="30">And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</v>
      <v n="31">And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="2">
      <v n="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</v>
      <v n="2">And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</v>
      <v n="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</v>
      <v n="4">These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</v>
      <v n="5">And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</v>
      <v n="6">But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</v>
      <v n="7">And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</v>
      <v n="8">And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</v>
      <v n="9">And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</v>
      <v n="10">And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</v>
      <v n="11">The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</v>
      <v n="12">And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</v>
      <v n="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</v>
      <v n="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</v>
      <v n="15">And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</v>
      <v n="16">And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</v>
      <v n="17">But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</v>
      <v n="18">And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</v>
      <v n="19">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</v>
      <v n="20">And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</v>
      <v n="21">And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</v>
      <v n="22">And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</v>
      <v n="23">And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</v>
      <v n="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</v>
      <v n="25">And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="3">
      <v n="1">Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</v>
      <v n="2">And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:</v>
      <v n="3">But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</v>
      <v n="4">And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</v>
      <v n="5">For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</v>
      <v n="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</v>
      <v n="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</v>
      <v n="8">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</v>
      <v n="9">And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?</v>
      <v n="10">And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</v>
      <v n="11">And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</v>
      <v n="12">And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</v>
      <v n="13">And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</v>
      <v n="14">And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:</v>
      <v n="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</v>
      <v n="16">Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</v>
      <v n="17">And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</v>
      <v n="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</v>
      <v n="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</v>
      <v n="20">And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</v>
      <v n="21">Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.</v>
      <v n="22">And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</v>
      <v n="23">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</v>
      <v n="24">So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="4">
      <v n="1">And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</v>
      <v n="2">And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</v>
      <v n="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</v>
      <v n="5">But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</v>
      <v n="6">And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</v>
      <v n="7">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</v>
      <v n="8">And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</v>
      <v n="9">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</v>
      <v n="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground.</v>
      <v n="11">And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</v>
      <v n="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.</v>
      <v n="13">And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</v>
      <v n="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</v>
      <v n="15">And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</v>
      <v n="16">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</v>
      <v n="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</v>
      <v n="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</v>
      <v n="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</v>
      <v n="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents, and of such as have cattle.</v>
      <v n="21">And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.</v>
      <v n="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.</v>
      <v n="23">And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</v>
      <v n="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</v>
      <v n="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</v>
      <v n="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="5">
      <v n="1">This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;</v>
      <v n="2">Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in the day when they were created.</v>
      <v n="3">And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:</v>
      <v n="4">And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="5">And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="6">And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:</v>
      <v n="7">And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="8">And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="9">And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:</v>
      <v n="10">And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="11">And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="12">And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:</v>
      <v n="13">And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="14">And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="15">And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:</v>
      <v n="16">And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="17">And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="18">And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat Enoch:</v>
      <v n="19">And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="20">And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="21">And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:</v>
      <v n="22">And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="23">And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five years:</v>
      <v n="24">And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.</v>
      <v n="25">And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and begat Lamech.</v>
      <v n="26">And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="27">And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="28">And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son:</v>
      <v n="29">And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the LORD hath cursed.</v>
      <v n="30">And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters:</v>
      <v n="31">And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years: and he died.</v>
      <v n="32">And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</v>

  <b n="Exodus">
    <c n="1">
      <v n="1">Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</v>
      <v n="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</v>
      <v n="3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</v>
      <v n="4">Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</v>
      <v n="5">And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</v>
      <v n="6">And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</v>
      <v n="7">And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</v>
      <v n="8">Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not Joseph.</v>
      <v n="9">And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we:</v>
      <v n="10">Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get them up out of the land.</v>
      <v n="11">Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses.</v>
      <v n="12">But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</v>
      <v n="13">And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour:</v>
      <v n="14">And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.</v>
      <v n="15">And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:</v>
      <v n="16">And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</v>
      <v n="17">But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive.</v>
      <v n="18">And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive?</v>
      <v n="19">And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.</v>
      <v n="20">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty.</v>
      <v n="21">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</v>
      <v n="22">And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="2">
      <v n="1">And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</v>
      <v n="2">And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</v>
      <v n="3">And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.</v>
      <v n="4">And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</v>
      <v n="5">And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</v>
      <v n="6">And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</v>
      <v n="7">Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</v>
      <v n="8">And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother.</v>
      <v n="9">And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.</v>
      <v n="10">And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</v>
      <v n="11">And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</v>
      <v n="12">And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</v>
      <v n="13">And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</v>
      <v n="14">And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</v>
      <v n="15">Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</v>
      <v n="16">Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</v>
      <v n="17">And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</v>
      <v n="18">And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day?</v>
      <v n="19">And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</v>
      <v n="20">And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</v>
      <v n="21">And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</v>
      <v n="22">And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</v>
      <v n="23">And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</v>
      <v n="24">And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</v>
      <v n="25">And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="3">
      <v n="1">Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.</v>
      <v n="2">And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</v>
      <v n="3">And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</v>
      <v n="4">And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.</v>
      <v n="5">And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.</v>
      <v n="6">Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.</v>
      <v n="7">And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;</v>
      <v n="8">And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</v>
      <v n="9">Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.</v>
      <v n="10">Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="11">And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?</v>
      <v n="12">And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</v>
      <v n="13">And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them?</v>
      <v n="14">And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.</v>
      <v n="15">And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.</v>
      <v n="16">Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:</v>
      <v n="17">And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</v>
      <v n="18">And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.</v>
      <v n="19">And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.</v>
      <v n="20">And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.</v>
      <v n="21">And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.</v>
      <v n="22">But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="4">
      <v n="1">And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared unto thee.</v>
      <v n="2">And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he said, A rod.</v>
      <v n="3">And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</v>
      <v n="4">And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:</v>
      <v n="5">That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</v>
      <v n="6">And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.</v>
      <v n="7">And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.</v>
      <v n="8">And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</v>
      <v n="9">And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.</v>
      <v n="10">And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</v>
      <v n="11">And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD?</v>
      <v n="12">Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.</v>
      <v n="13">And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.</v>
      <v n="14">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.</v>
      <v n="15">And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.</v>
      <v n="16">And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God.</v>
      <v n="17">And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt do signs.</v>
      <v n="18">And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</v>
      <v n="19">And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.</v>
      <v n="20">And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</v>
      <v n="21">And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go.</v>
      <v n="22">And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:</v>
      <v n="23">And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.</v>
      <v n="24">And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</v>
      <v n="25">Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.</v>
      <v n="26">So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.</v>
      <v n="27">And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.</v>
      <v n="28">And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.</v>
      <v n="29">And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel:</v>
      <v n="30">And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</v>
      <v n="31">And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="5">
      <v n="1">And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</v>
      <v n="2">And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go.</v>
      <v n="3">And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</v>
      <v n="4">And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.</v>
      <v n="5">And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</v>
      <v n="6">And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</v>
      <v n="7">Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</v>
      <v n="8">And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</v>
      <v n="9">Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard vain words.</v>
      <v n="10">And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</v>
      <v n="11">Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of your work shall be diminished.</v>
      <v n="12">So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.</v>
      <v n="13">And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.</v>
      <v n="14">And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?</v>
      <v n="15">Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</v>
      <v n="16">There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.</v>
      <v n="17">But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.</v>
      <v n="18">Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.</v>
      <v n="19">And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task.</v>
      <v n="20">And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh:</v>
      <v n="21">And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</v>
      <v n="22">And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me?</v>
      <v n="23">For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="6">
      <v n="1">Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</v>
      <v n="2">And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:</v>
      <v n="3">And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them.</v>
      <v n="4">And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.</v>
      <v n="5">And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.</v>
      <v n="6">Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:</v>
      <v n="7">And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</v>
      <v n="8">And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.</v>
      <v n="9">And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</v>
      <v n="10">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="11">Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.</v>
      <v n="12">And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?</v>
      <v n="13">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="14">These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.</v>
      <v n="15">And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman: these are the families of Simeon.</v>
      <v n="16">And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.</v>
      <v n="17">The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.</v>
      <v n="18">And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred thirty and three years.</v>
      <v n="19">And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the families of Levi according to their generations.</v>
      <v n="20">And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.</v>
      <v n="21">And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.</v>
      <v n="22">And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.</v>
      <v n="23">And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</v>
      <v n="24">And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these are the families of the Korhites.</v>
      <v n="25">And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.</v>
      <v n="26">These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to their armies.</v>
      <v n="27">These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.</v>
      <v n="28">And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses in the land of Egypt,</v>
      <v n="29">That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.</v>
      <v n="30">And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?</v>
    </c>
    <c n="7">
      <v n="1">And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.</v>
      <v n="2">Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.</v>
      <v n="3">And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="4">But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</v>
      <v n="5">And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.</v>
      <v n="6">And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did they.</v>
      <v n="7">And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.</v>
      <v n="8">And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</v>
      <v n="9">When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.</v>
      <v n="10">And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</v>
      <v n="11">Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments.</v>
      <v n="12">For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.</v>
      <v n="13">And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</v>
      <v n="14">And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he refuseth to let the people go.</v>
      <v n="15">Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</v>
      <v n="16">And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</v>
      <v n="17">Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</v>
      <v n="18">And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river.</v>
      <v n="19">And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.</v>
      <v n="20">And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.</v>
      <v n="21">And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="22">And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the LORD had said.</v>
      <v n="23">And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set his heart to this also.</v>
      <v n="24">And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</v>
      <v n="25">And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten the river.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="8">
      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</v>
      <v n="2">And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:</v>
      <v n="3">And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:</v>
      <v n="4">And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants.</v>
      <v n="5">And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="6">And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="7">And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="8">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="9">And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only?</v>
      <v n="10">And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the LORD our God.</v>
      <v n="11">And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only.</v>
      <v n="12">And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</v>
      <v n="13">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</v>
      <v n="14">And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land stank.</v>
      <v n="15">But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</v>
      <v n="16">And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="17">And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="18">And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</v>
      <v n="19">Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.</v>
      <v n="20">And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water; and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</v>
      <v n="21">Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.</v>
      <v n="22">And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth.</v>
      <v n="23">And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to morrow shall this sign be.</v>
      <v n="24">And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.</v>
      <v n="25">And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</v>
      <v n="26">And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</v>
      <v n="27">We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</v>
      <v n="28">And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: intreat for me.</v>
      <v n="29">And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</v>
      <v n="30">And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</v>
      <v n="31">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.</v>
      <v n="32">And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="9">
      <v n="1">Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</v>
      <v n="2">For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,</v>
      <v n="3">Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.</v>
      <v n="4">And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is the children's of Israel.</v>
      <v n="5">And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD shall do this thing in the land.</v>
      <v n="6">And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.</v>
      <v n="7">And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</v>
      <v n="8">And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</v>
      <v n="9">And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="10">And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.</v>
      <v n="11">And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</v>
      <v n="12">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.</v>
      <v n="13">And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</v>
      <v n="14">For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.</v>
      <v n="15">For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.</v>
      <v n="16">And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.</v>
      <v n="17">As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go?</v>
      <v n="18">Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.</v>
      <v n="19">Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</v>
      <v n="20">He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:</v>
      <v n="21">And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.</v>
      <v n="22">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="23">And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="24">So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</v>
      <v n="25">And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.</v>
      <v n="26">Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.</v>
      <v n="27">And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</v>
      <v n="28">Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.</v>
      <v n="29">And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.</v>
      <v n="30">But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God.</v>
      <v n="31">And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.</v>
      <v n="32">But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not grown up.</v>
      <v n="33">And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.</v>
      <v n="34">And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.</v>
      <v n="35">And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="10">
      <v n="1">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I might shew these my signs before him:</v>
      <v n="2">And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD.</v>
      <v n="3">And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.</v>
      <v n="4">Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow will I bring the locusts into thy coast:</v>
      <v n="5">And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:</v>
      <v n="6">And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh.</v>
      <v n="7">And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?</v>
      <v n="8">And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go?</v>
      <v n="9">And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="10">And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.</v>
      <v n="11">Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.</v>
      <v n="12">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.</v>
      <v n="13">And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.</v>
      <v n="14">And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.</v>
      <v n="15">For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="16">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.</v>
      <v n="17">Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this death only.</v>
      <v n="18">And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.</v>
      <v n="19">And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="20">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go.</v>
      <v n="21">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.</v>
      <v n="22">And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:</v>
      <v n="23">They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.</v>
      <v n="24">And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.</v>
      <v n="25">And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.</v>
      <v n="26">Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither.</v>
      <v n="27">But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go.</v>
      <v n="28">And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die.</v>
      <v n="29">And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="11">
      <v n="1">And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.</v>
      <v n="2">Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of silver and jewels of gold.</v>
      <v n="3">And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people.</v>
      <v n="4">And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:</v>
      <v n="5">And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and all the firstborn of beasts.</v>
      <v n="6">And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it any more.</v>
      <v n="7">But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel.</v>
      <v n="8">And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.</v>
      <v n="9">And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="10">And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go out of his land.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="12">
      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying,</v>
      <v n="2">This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you.</v>
      <v n="3">Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:</v>
      <v n="4">And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.</v>
      <v n="5">Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:</v>
      <v n="6">And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.</v>
      <v n="7">And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.</v>
      <v n="8">And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.</v>
      <v n="9">Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.</v>
      <v n="10">And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</v>
      <v n="11">And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD's passover.</v>
      <v n="12">For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.</v>
      <v n="13">And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="14">And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.</v>
      <v n="15">Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</v>
      <v n="16">And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done of you.</v>
      <v n="17">And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever.</v>
      <v n="18">In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and twentieth day of the month at even.</v>
      <v n="19">Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.</v>
      <v n="20">Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.</v>
      <v n="21">Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.</v>
      <v n="22">And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.</v>
      <v n="23">For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.</v>
      <v n="24">And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.</v>
      <v n="25">And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.</v>
      <v n="26">And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?</v>
      <v n="27">That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.</v>
      <v n="28">And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</v>
      <v n="29">And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.</v>
      <v n="30">And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.</v>
      <v n="31">And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.</v>
      <v n="32">Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.</v>
      <v n="33">And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all dead men.</v>
      <v n="34">And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.</v>
      <v n="35">And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment:</v>
      <v n="36">And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.</v>
      <v n="37">And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children.</v>
      <v n="38">And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very much cattle.</v>
      <v n="39">And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victual.</v>
      <v n="40">Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.</v>
      <v n="41">And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="42">It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their generations.</v>
      <v n="43">And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:</v>
      <v n="44">But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.</v>
      <v n="45">A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.</v>
      <v n="46">In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.</v>
      <v n="47">All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.</v>
      <v n="48">And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof.</v>
      <v n="49">One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you.</v>
      <v n="50">Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.</v>
      <v n="51">And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="13">
      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.</v>
      <v n="3">And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.</v>
      <v n="4">This day came ye out in the month Abib.</v>
      <v n="5">And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.</v>
      <v n="6">Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD.</v>
      <v n="7">Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.</v>
      <v n="8">And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth out of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="9">And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="10">Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year.</v>
      <v n="11">And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee,</v>
      <v n="12">That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast; the males shall be the LORD's.</v>
      <v n="13">And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem.</v>
      <v n="14">And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:</v>
      <v n="15">And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.</v>
      <v n="16">And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="17">And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt:</v>
      <v n="18">But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="19">And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.</v>
      <v n="20">And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.</v>
      <v n="21">And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light; to go by day and night:</v>
      <v n="22">He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="14">
      <v n="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.</v>
      <v n="3">For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.</v>
      <v n="4">And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so.</v>
      <v n="5">And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?</v>
      <v n="6">And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:</v>
      <v n="7">And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</v>
      <v n="8">And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.</v>
      <v n="9">But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baalzephon.</v>
      <v n="10">And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="11">And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out of Egypt?</v>
      <v n="12">Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness.</v>
      <v n="13">And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see them again no more for ever.</v>
      <v n="14">The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.</v>
      <v n="15">And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:</v>
      <v n="16">But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.</v>
      <v n="17">And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</v>
      <v n="18">And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen.</v>
      <v n="19">And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them:</v>
      <v n="20">And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night.</v>
      <v n="21">And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.</v>
      <v n="22">And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</v>
      <v n="23">And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.</v>
      <v n="24">And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,</v>
      <v n="25">And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians.</v>
      <v n="26">And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen.</v>
      <v n="27">And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.</v>
      <v n="28">And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.</v>
      <v n="29">But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left.</v>
      <v n="30">Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore.</v>
      <v n="31">And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="15">
      <v n="1">Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</v>
      <v n="2">The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him.</v>
      <v n="3">The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</v>
      <v n="4">Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.</v>
      <v n="5">The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.</v>
      <v n="6">Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</v>
      <v n="7">And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.</v>
      <v n="8">And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.</v>
      <v n="9">The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.</v>
      <v n="10">Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters.</v>
      <v n="11">Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</v>
      <v n="12">Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.</v>
      <v n="13">Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.</v>
      <v n="14">The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina.</v>
      <v n="15">Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.</v>
      <v n="16">Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.</v>
      <v n="17">Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have established.</v>
      <v n="18">The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.</v>
      <v n="19">For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea.</v>
      <v n="20">And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.</v>
      <v n="21">And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.</v>
      <v n="22">So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.</v>
      <v n="23">And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.</v>
      <v n="24">And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?</v>
      <v n="25">And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree, which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them,</v>
      <v n="26">And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that healeth thee.</v>
      <v n="27">And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="16">
      <v n="1">And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="2">And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</v>
      <v n="3">And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</v>
      <v n="4">Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</v>
      <v n="5">And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</v>
      <v n="6">And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt:</v>
      <v n="7">And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us?</v>
      <v n="8">And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.</v>
      <v n="9">And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings.</v>
      <v n="10">And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</v>
      <v n="11">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</v>
      <v n="12">I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God.</v>
      <v n="13">And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</v>
      <v n="14">And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</v>
      <v n="15">And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat.</v>
      <v n="16">This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents.</v>
      <v n="17">And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</v>
      <v n="18">And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</v>
      <v n="19">And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</v>
      <v n="20">Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.</v>
      <v n="21">And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</v>
      <v n="22">And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</v>
      <v n="23">And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</v>
      <v n="24">And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</v>
      <v n="25">And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.</v>
      <v n="26">Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</v>
      <v n="27">And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</v>
      <v n="28">And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws?</v>
      <v n="29">See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</v>
      <v n="30">So the people rested on the seventh day.</v>
      <v n="31">And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</v>
      <v n="32">And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</v>
      <v n="33">And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</v>
      <v n="34">As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</v>
      <v n="35">And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.</v>
      <v n="36">Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="17">
      <v n="1">And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink.</v>
      <v n="2">Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?</v>
      <v n="3">And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst?</v>
      <v n="4">And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto this people? they be almost ready to stone me.</v>
      <v n="5">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.</v>
      <v n="6">Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.</v>
      <v n="7">And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?</v>
      <v n="8">Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</v>
      <v n="9">And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine hand.</v>
      <v n="10">So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.</v>
      <v n="11">And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.</v>
      <v n="12">But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</v>
      <v n="13">And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.</v>
      <v n="14">And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</v>
      <v n="15">And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Jehovahnissi:</v>
      <v n="16">For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="18">
      <v n="1">When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;</v>
      <v n="2">Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife, after he had sent her back,</v>
      <v n="3">And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</v>
      <v n="4">And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:</v>
      <v n="5">And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</v>
      <v n="6">And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</v>
      <v n="7">And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.</v>
      <v n="8">And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</v>
      <v n="9">And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</v>
      <v n="10">And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</v>
      <v n="11">Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</v>
      <v n="12">And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.</v>
      <v n="13">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening.</v>
      <v n="14">And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even?</v>
      <v n="15">And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God:</v>
      <v n="16">When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</v>
      <v n="17">And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.</v>
      <v n="18">Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.</v>
      <v n="19">Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that thou mayest bring the causes unto God:</v>
      <v n="20">And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</v>
      <v n="21">Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</v>
      <v n="22">And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.</v>
      <v n="23">If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</v>
      <v n="24">So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</v>
      <v n="25">And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</v>
      <v n="26">And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</v>
      <v n="27">And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="19">
      <v n="1">In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.</v>
      <v n="2">For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</v>
      <v n="3">And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</v>
      <v n="4">Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.</v>
      <v n="5">Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people: for all the earth is mine:</v>
      <v n="6">And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.</v>
      <v n="7">And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</v>
      <v n="8">And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="9">And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD.</v>
      <v n="10">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</v>
      <v n="11">And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.</v>
      <v n="12">And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death:</v>
      <v n="13">There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.</v>
      <v n="14">And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</v>
      <v n="15">And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.</v>
      <v n="16">And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.</v>
      <v n="17">And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</v>
      <v n="18">And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</v>
      <v n="19">And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice.</v>
      <v n="20">And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</v>
      <v n="21">And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</v>
      <v n="22">And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.</v>
      <v n="23">And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</v>
      <v n="24">And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them.</v>
      <v n="25">So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.</v>
    </c>
    <c n="20">
      <v n="1">And God spake all these words, saying,</v>
      <v n="2">I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</v>
      <v n="3">Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</v>
      <v n="4">Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.</v>
      <v n="5">Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;</v>
      <v n="6">And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</v>
      <v n="7">Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</v>
      <v n="8">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</v>
      <v n="9">Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</v>
      <v n="10">But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:</v>
      <v n="11">For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</v>
      <v n="12">Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</v>
      <v n="13">Thou shalt not kill.</v>
      <v n="14">Thou shalt not commit adultery.</v>
      <v n="15">Thou shalt not steal.</v>
      <v n="16">Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</v>
      <v n="17">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.</v>
      <v n="18">And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.</v>
      <v n="19">And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</v>
      <v n="20">And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</v>
      <v n="21">And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.</v>
      <v n="22">And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</v>
      <v n="23">Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</v>
      <v n="24">An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</v>
      <v n="25">And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</v>
      <v n="26">Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</v>
